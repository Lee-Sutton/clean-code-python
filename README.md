## Introduction

### Why do we need clean code?
"The ratio of time spent on reading vs writing code is well over 10:1. We are constantly reading old code
as part of the effort to write new code. Making code easier to read makes it easier to write" [ref bob martin]

The boy scout rule:
- if we all checked in code a little cleaner than when we checked it out, the code can simply not rot.
- Can you imagine working on a project where the code got better as time went on? :mindblown:

Inspired from [clean-code-javascript](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-ruby)

Targets Python3.7+

## **Variables**
- Use intention revealing names and don't be afraid to change them if you find better names
- Why does it exist? How is it used? 
- If a name requires a comment it does not reveal it's intention

Bad:
```python
d: int  # elapsed time in days
```
Good:
```python
elapsed_time_in_days: int
```

Be explicit with your variable names

```python
def get_them(input_list):
    output = []
    for x in intput_list:
        if x == 4
            output.append(x)
        
    return output
```

What sorts of things are implied by this code?
1. What kinds of things are in `input_list`?
2. What is the significance of the value 4?
3. How would I use the list being returned?


better:
```python
FLAGGED = 4

def get_flagged_cell(cells):
    flagged_cells = []
    for cell in cells:
        if cell == FLAGGED:
            flagged_cells.append(x)
        
    return flagged_cells
```

best: (sidenote about list comprehensions)
```python
def get_flagged_cell(cells):
    return [cell for cell in cells if cell == FLAGGED]
```

Notice how much more *EXPLICIT* the code is in the improved examples

### Use meaningful and pronounceable variable names

**Bad:**
```python
import datetime


ymdstr = datetime.date.today().strftime("%y-%m-%d")
```
How do I pronounce this? "yem dee string"? Fun or not, we're tolerating poor naming here. New developers
will have to have this variable explained to them. Use proper english terms even if the term is a little
longer. Let autocomplete save the keystrokes for you.

**Good**:
```python
import datetime


current_date: str = datetime.date.today().strftime("%y-%m-%d")
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Use the same vocabulary for the same type of variable

**Bad:**
Here we use three different names for the same underlying entity:
```python
def get_user_info(): pass
def get_client_data(): pass
def get_customer_record(): pass
```

**Good**:
If the entity is the same, you should be consistent in referring to it in your functions:
```python
def get_user_info(): pass
def get_user_data(): pass
def get_user_record(): pass
```

**Even better**
Python is (also) an object oriented programming language. If it makes sense, package the functions together with the concrete implementation
of the entity in your code, as instance attributes, property methods, or methods:

```python
from typing import Union, Dict, Text


class Record:
    pass


class User:
    info : str

    @property
    def data(self) -> Dict[Text, Text]:
        return {}

    def get_record(self) -> Union[Record, None]:
        return Record()
        
```

You want to avoid adding noise to your variable names. Noise words add "meaningless" distinction. In the above example
`info` and `data` are indistinct noise words. How do programmers know which function to call?
Distinguish names so the reader knows the difference

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Use searchable names
We will read more code than we will ever write. It"s important that the code we do write is 
readable and searchable. By *not* naming variables that end up being meaningful for 
understanding our program, we hurt our readers.
Make your names searchable.

**Bad:**
```python
import time


# What is the number 86400 for again?
time.sleep(86400)
```

**Good**:
```python
import time


# Declare them in the global namespace for the module.
SECONDS_IN_A_DAY = 60 * 60 * 24
time.sleep(SECONDS_IN_A_DAY)
```

Single letter variable names should almost always be avoided. Personally, I like the length of the name 
to correspond to the size of its scope. If a variable or constant is used in multiple places/bodies of code
it is imperative that you give it a search friendly name.

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Avoid encodings
In modern python we have a rich type annotation system and we can use type checkers
to enforce these types, if you want to add them. What you want to avoid is adding type
information to the variable name. Given that python is also a dynamic language this may
also lead to disinformation.

Bad
```python
car_dict = {"make": "tesla"}
```

Better:
```python
car = {"make": "tesla"}
```

### Use explanatory variables
**Bad:**
```python
import re


address = "One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014"
city_zip_code_regex = r"^[^,\\]+[,\\\s]+(.+?)\s*(\d{5})?$"

matches = re.match(city_zip_code_regex, address)
if matches:
    print(f"{matches[1]}: {matches[2]}")
```

**Not bad**:

It"s better, but we are still heavily dependent on regex.

```python
import re


address = "One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014"
city_zip_code_regex = r"^[^,\\]+[,\\\s]+(.+?)\s*(\d{5})?$"
matches = re.match(city_zip_code_regex, address)

if matches:
    city, zip_code = matches.groups()
    print(f"{city}: {zip_code}")
```

**Good**:

Decrease dependence on regex by naming subpatterns.
```python
import re


address = "One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014"
city_zip_code_regex = r"^[^,\\]+[,\\\s]+(?P<city>.+?)\s*(?P<zip_code>\d{5})?$"

matches = re.match(city_zip_code_regex, address)
if matches:
    print(f"{matches['city']}, {matches['zip_code']}")
```

### Avoid Mental Mapping
Don’t force the reader of your code to translate what the variable means.
Explicit is better than implicit.

**Bad:**
```python
seq = ("Austin", "New York", "San Francisco")

for item in seq:
    #do_stuff()
    #do_some_other_stuff()

    # Wait, what's `item` again?
    print(item)
```

**Good**:
```python
locations = ("Austin", "New York", "San Francisco")

for location in locations:
    #do_stuff()
    #do_some_other_stuff()
    # ...
    print(location)
```
**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**


### Don"t add unneeded context
This avoids adding disinformation. Do not refer to a a grouping of accounts
as an `accounts_list` unless your stakeholders say it's a list. Try to use
vocabulary from the business domain if your class/object name tells you something, 
don't repeat that in your variable name.

**Bad:**

```python
class Car:
    car_make: str
    car_model: str
    car_color: str
```

**Good**:

```python
class Car:
    make: str
    model: str
    color: str
```

### Pick one word per concept
Pick one word for an abstract concept and stick with it. For example, it's confusing to have
`fetch`, `retrieve`, `get` as equivalent methods on different classes. How do you remember
which name goes on each class? 

_"A consistent lexicon is a great boon to the programmers who must use your code"_

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Use default arguments instead of short circuiting or conditionals

**Tricky**

Why write:

```python
import hashlib


def create_micro_brewery(name):
    name = "Hipster Brew Co." if name is None else name
    slug = hashlib.sha1(name.encode()).hexdigest()
    # etc.
```

... when you can specify a default argument instead? This also makes it clear that
you are expecting a string as the argument.

**Good**:

```python
from typing import Text
import hashlib


def create_micro_brewery(name: Text = "Hipster Brew Co."):
    slug = hashlib.sha1(name.encode()).hexdigest()
    # etc.
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**
## **Functions**
### Function arguments (2 or fewer ideally)
Limiting the amount of function parameters is incredibly important because it makes 
testing your function easier. Having more than three leads to a combinatorial explosion 
where you have to test tons of different cases with each separate argument.

Zero arguments is the ideal case. One or two arguments is ok, and three should be avoided. 
Anything more than that should be consolidated. Usually, if you have more than two 
arguments then your function is trying to do too much. In cases where it"s not, most 
of the time a higher-level object will suffice as an argument.

**Bad:**
```python
def create_menu(title, body, button_text, cancellable):
    pass
```

**Java-esque**:
```python
class Menu:
    def __init__(self, config: dict):
        self.title = config["title"]
        self.body = config["body"]
        # ...

menu = Menu(
    {
        "title": "My Menu",
        "body": "Something about my menu",
        "button_text": "OK",
        "cancellable": False
    }
)
```

**Also good**
```python
from typing import Text


class MenuConfig:
    """A configuration for the Menu.

    Attributes:
        title: The title of the Menu.
        body: The body of the Menu.
        button_text: The text for the button label.
        cancellable: Can it be cancelled?
    """
    title: Text
    body: Text
    button_text: Text
    cancellable: bool = False


def create_menu(config: MenuConfig) -> None:
    title = config.title
    body = config.body
    # ...


config = MenuConfig()
config.title = "My delicious menu"
config.body = "A description of the various items on the menu"
config.button_text = "Order now!"
# The instance attribute overrides the default class attribute.
config.cancellable = True

create_menu(config)
```

**Fancy**
```python
from typing import NamedTuple


class MenuConfig(NamedTuple):
    """A configuration for the Menu.

    Attributes:
        title: The title of the Menu.
        body: The body of the Menu.
        button_text: The text for the button label.
        cancellable: Can it be cancelled?
    """
    title: str
    body: str
    button_text: str
    cancellable: bool = False


def create_menu(config: MenuConfig):
    title, body, button_text, cancellable = config
    # ...


create_menu(
    MenuConfig(
        title="My delicious menu",
        body="A description of the various items on the menu",
        button_text="Order now!"
    )
)
```

**Even fancier**
```python
from typing import Text
from dataclasses import astuple, dataclass


@dataclass
class MenuConfig:
    """A configuration for the Menu.

    Attributes:
        title: The title of the Menu.
        body: The body of the Menu.
        button_text: The text for the button label.
        cancellable: Can it be cancelled?
    """
    title: Text
    body: Text
    button_text: Text
    cancellable: bool = False

def create_menu(config: MenuConfig):
    title, body, button_text, cancellable = astuple(config)
    # ...


create_menu(
    MenuConfig(
        title="My delicious menu",
        body="A description of the various items on the menu",
        button_text="Order now!"
    )
)
```

**Even fancier, Python3.8+ only**
```python
from typing import TypedDict, Text


class MenuConfig(TypedDict):
    """A configuration for the Menu.

    Attributes:
        title: The title of the Menu.
        body: The body of the Menu.
        button_text: The text for the button label.
        cancellable: Can it be cancelled?
    """
    title: Text
    body: Text
    button_text: Text
    cancellable: bool


def create_menu(config: MenuConfig):
    title = config["title"]
    # ...


create_menu(
    # You need to supply all the parameters
    MenuConfig(
        title="My delicious menu", 
        body="A description of the various items on the menu",
        button_text="Order now!",
        cancellable=True
    )
)
```

### Functions should do one thing
This is by far the most important rule in software engineering. When functions do more 
than one thing, they are harder to compose, test, and reason about. When you can isolate 
a function to just one action, they can be refactored easily and your code will read much 
cleaner. If you take nothing else away from this guide other than this, you"ll be ahead 
of many developers.

**Bad:**
```python
from typing import List


class Client:
    active: bool


def email(client: Client) -> None:
    pass


def email_clients(clients: List[Client]) -> None:
    """Filter active clients and send them an email.
    """
    for client in clients:
        if client.active:
            email(client)
```

**Good**:
```python
from typing import List


class Client:
    active: bool


def email(client: Client) -> None:
    pass


def get_active_clients(clients: List[Client]) -> List[Client]:
    """Filter active clients.
    """
    return [client for client in clients if client.active]


def email_clients(clients: List[Client]) -> None:
    """Send an email to a given list of clients.
    """
    for client in get_active_clients(clients):
        email(client)
```

Do you see an opportunity for using generators now?

**Even better**
```python
from typing import Generator, Iterator


class Client:
    active: bool


def email(client: Client):
    pass


def active_clients(clients: Iterator[Client]) -> Generator[Client, None, None]:
    """Only active clients"""
    return (client for client in clients if client.active)


def email_client(clients: Iterator[Client]) -> None:
    """Send an email to a given list of clients.
    """
    for client in active_clients(clients):
        email(client)
```


**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Function names should say what they do

**Bad:**

```python
class Email:
    def handle(self) -> None:
        pass

message = Email()
# What is this supposed to do again?
message.handle()
```

**Good:**

```python
class Email:
    def send(self) -> None:
        """Send this message"""

message = Email()
message.send()
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Functions should only be one level of abstraction

When you have more than one level of abstraction, your function is usually doing too 
much. Splitting up functions leads to reusability and easier testing.

**Bad:**

```python
# type: ignore

def parse_better_js_alternative(code: str) -> None:
    regexes = [
        # ...
    ]

    statements = code.split('\n')
    tokens = []
    for regex in regexes:
        for statement in statements:
            pass

    ast = []
    for token in tokens:
        pass

    for node in ast:
        pass
```

**Good:**

```python
from typing import Tuple, List, Text, Dict


REGEXES: Tuple = (
   # ...
)


def parse_better_js_alternative(code: Text) -> None:
    tokens: List = tokenize(code)
    syntax_tree: List = parse(tokens)

    for node in syntax_tree:
        pass


def tokenize(code: Text) -> List:
    statements = code.split()
    tokens: List[Dict] = []
    for regex in REGEXES:
        for statement in statements:
            pass

    return tokens


def parse(tokens: List) -> List:
    syntax_tree: List[Dict] = []
    for token in tokens:
        pass

    return syntax_tree
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Don"t use flags as function parameters

Flags tell your user that this function does more than one thing. Functions 
should do one thing. Split your functions if they are following different code 
paths based on a boolean.

**Bad:**

```python
from typing import Text
from tempfile import gettempdir
from pathlib import Path


def create_file(name: Text, temp: bool) -> None:
    if temp:
        (Path(gettempdir()) / name).touch()
    else:
        Path(name).touch()
```

**Good:**

```python
from typing import Text
from tempfile import gettempdir
from pathlib import Path


def create_file(name: Text) -> None:
    Path(name).touch()


def create_temp_file(name: Text) -> None:
    (Path(gettempdir()) / name).touch()
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Avoid side effects

A function produces a side effect if it does anything other than take a value in 
and return another value or values. For example, a side effect could be writing 
to a file, modifying some global variable, or accidentally wiring all your money
to a stranger.

Now, you do need to have side effects in a program on occasion - for example, like
in the previous example, you might need to write to a file. In these cases, you
should centralize and indicate where you are incorporating side effects. Don"t have
several functions and classes that write to a particular file - rather, have one
(and only one) service that does it.

The main point is to avoid common pitfalls like sharing state between objects
without any structure, using mutable data types that can be written to by anything,
or using an instance of a class, and not centralizing where your side effects occur.
If you can do this, you will be happier than the vast majority of other programmers.

**Bad:**

```python
# type: ignore

# This is a module-level name.
# It"s good practice to define these as immutable values, such as a string.
# However...
fullname = "Ryan McDermott"

def split_into_first_and_last_name() -> None:
    # The use of the global keyword here is changing the meaning of the
    # the following line. This function is now mutating the module-level
    # state and introducing a side-effect!
    global fullname
    fullname = fullname.split()

split_into_first_and_last_name()

# MyPy will spot the problem, complaining about 'Incompatible types in 
# assignment: (expression has type "List[str]", variable has type "str")'
print(fullname)  # ["Ryan", "McDermott"]

# OK. It worked the first time, but what will happen if we call the
# function again?
```

**Good:**
```python
from typing import List, AnyStr


def split_into_first_and_last_name(name: AnyStr) -> List[AnyStr]:
    return name.split()

fullname = "Ryan McDermott"
name, surname = split_into_first_and_last_name(fullname)

print(name, surname)  # => Ryan McDermott
```

**Also good**
```python
from typing import Text
from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass
class Person:
    name: Text

    @property
    def name_as_first_and_last(self) -> list:
        return self.name.split() 


# The reason why we create instances of classes is to manage state!
person = Person("Ryan McDermott")
print(person.name)  # => "Ryan McDermott"
print(person.name_as_first_and_last)  # => ["Ryan", "McDermott"]
```

### Avoiding side effects part 2
In Python, everything is an object and everything is passed by value, 
but these values are references to objects. In the case of objects and lists, if your method makes a change
in a shopping cart array, for example, by adding an item to purchase,
then any other method that uses that `cart` array will be affected by this
addition. That may be great, however it can be bad too. Let's imagine a bad
situation:

The user clicks the "Purchase", button which calls a `purchase` method that
spawns a network request and sends the `cart` array to the server. Because
of a bad network connection, the `purchase` method has to keep retrying the
request. Now, what if in the meantime the user accidentally clicks "Add to Cart"
button on an item they don't actually want before the network request begins?
If that happens and the network request begins, then that purchase method
will send the accidentally added item because it has a reference to a shopping
cart array that the `add_item_to_cart` method modified by adding an unwanted
item.

A great solution would be for the `add_item_to_cart` to always clone the `cart`,
edit it, and return the clone. This ensures that no other methods that are
holding onto a reference of the shopping cart will be affected by any changes.

Two caveats to mention to this approach:
  1. There might be cases where you actually want to modify the input object,
but when you adopt this programming practice you will find that those cases
are pretty rare. Most things can be refactored to have no side effects!

  2. Python comes built in the with a [copy](https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html) 
  module which allows for copying and deep copying objects.

  3. Cloning big objects can be expensive in terms of performance. So if you find that you're doing it
  often, you may want to consider implementing the `__copy__` and `__deepcopy__` methods for improved
  performance. More info [here](https://pymotw.com/3/copy/)

**Bad:**
```python
from datetime import datetime

def add_item_to_cart(cart: list, item):
  cart.append({"item": item, "time": datetime.now()})
```

**Good:**
```python
from datetime import datetime

def add_item_to_cart(cart, item):
    cart_copy = cart[:]
    cart_copy.append({"item": item, "time": datetime.now()})
    return cart_copy
```

# **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
The DIP amounts to the following: 
- *Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.*

The object of this principle is to help decouple software and render high-level modules independant from low-level module implementation details. In detail, the principle states:
1. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g. interfaces).
2. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions.

By dictating that both high-level and low-level objects must depend on the same abstraction, this design principle inverts the way some people may think about object-oriented programming.

Thinking about the interactions as abstract concepts themselves, allows us to de-couple components while maintaining a lighter and less implementation-dependant interaction schema.

Sources for this module: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle), [Head First Design Patterns](http://ce.sharif.edu/courses/96-97/2/ce484-1/resources/root/Design%20Patterns/Eric%20Freeman,%20Elisabeth%20Freeman,%20Kathy%20Sierra,%20Bert%20Bates-Head%20First%20Design%20Patterns%20-OReilly%20(2008).pdf)

### **Mixins**
Mixins are a special type of multiple inheritance. There are two typical situations that 
require mixins:
1. You want to add in a lot of features and/or methods for a class
2. You want to use a particular feature and/or across many different classes

Sometimes we might refer to mixins as being `included` as opposed to `inherited`. Mixins help us abide by the [dependancy inversion principle](#dependency-inversion-principle-dip). Lets walk through the following example where we image we're game makers creating an open world safari adventure game! Let's define some animals:

**Bad Design:**
```python
class Hare:
    def run(self):
        pass
    def sleep(self):
        pass
    def eat(self):
        pass

class Eagle:
    def fly(self):
        pass
    def sleep(self):
        pass
    def eat(self):
       pass
```
And now we realise the scope of our project requires a turtle that can also `sleep` and `eat`. So, as we know, inheritance can be a powerful tool and also save us some time writting code. So we attempt the following:
```python
class Turtle(Hare):
    def swim(self):
        pass
```
But, we now realise that Turtle don't run, they crawl. Well, we simply overide our run method to call to our crawl method:
```python 
class Turtle(Hare):
    def swim(self):
        pass
    def crawl(self):
        pass
    def run(self):
        return self.crawl()  
```
Well, okay. That might have fixed it. But does this really make sense? Or is there a *base abstraction* we can pull out here? We will come back to this later. 

We just got an update from marketing that the latest research indicates that gamers really want to play as a Canadian Goose! Well, Canadian Goose swim, run, fly, sleep AND most importantly, poop. So we do the following:

```python 
class CanadianGoose(Hare, Eagle, Turtle):
    def poop(self):
        pass
```
Okay, that was somewhat easy. We have multiple inheritance that seems to cover all of our basses. But lets think about this a little bit. What happens when we ask our Canadian Goose to run? Which class method gets chosen? The same issue goes for when we ask the Canadian Goose to sleep or eat, what would happen? Imagine having to debug this in production! We call this issue the [**Diamond Problem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance#The_diamond_problem).

So lets go over all our current concerns:
1. This is clearly confusing to any reader. 
2. Inherting from concrete classes begins to introduce dependency webs.
3. Debugging can become a nightmare!

**Better Design**:

Imagine we got to go back in time and right our wrongs. What might we have done differently?

1. Instead of having our `Turtle` inherit from a `Hare` we create a *abstract* mixin that they BOTH inherit from.

```python
class AnimalMixin:
    def sleep(self):
        pass
    def eat(self):
        pass

class Hare(AnimalMixin):
    def run(self):
        pass

class Eagle(AnimalMixin):
    def fly(self):
        pass

class Turtle(AnimalMixin):
    def swim(self):
        pass
    def crawl(self):
        pass
```
2. Instead of having our Duck inherite from any one class, we can inherit from the AnimalMixin and also create other sets of mixins for the common methods shared across classes. This will allow us to easily identify any potential issues when methods are called and also consolidate code.
```python
class AnimalMixin:
    def sleep(self):
        pass
    def eat(self):
        pass
    def poop(self):
        pass

class BirdMixin:
    def fly(self):
        pass

class SwimMixin: # Can you think of a better name?
    def swim(self):
        pass

class Hare(AnimalMixin):
    def run(self):
        pass

class Eagle(AnimalMixin, BirdMixin):
    pass

class Turtle(AnimalMixin, SwimMixin):
    def crawl(self):
        pass

class CanadianGoose(AnimialMixin, BirdMixin, SwimMixin):
        pass

```
From here we could go on and on adding in new classes. For instance, what might we refactor into a Mixin class if we added a `Cheetah`, `Gazelle` and `Springbok`? We could do the refactoring in advance (or in anticipation) but that in itself can lead to errors and complications. Why should there be an abstraction if its only being used in one place? 

**Takeaways:**
1. Avoid inheriting from concrete classes at all costs
2. Use Abstractions(Mixins) in place
3. Only create abstractions when there is an existing use case (avoid confusing readers)
